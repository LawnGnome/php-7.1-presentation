didn't 7.0 just come out?

new features
	types
		nullable types: function foo(?string $foo): ?string
		void return type: function foo(): void
		iterable pseudo-type (array or Traversable)
	OOP
		class constant visibility
		multi catch: catch (A | B $e)
	general
		negative string offsets
	omit
		Closure::fromCallable()
		async signal handling
		destructuring: [$a, $b] = $array
		keys in destructuring: ['id' => $id, 'name' => $name] = $array

incompatibilities
	keep
		passing too few parameters now results in ArgumentCountError
		void and iterable no longer valid class/interface/trait names
		mt_rand() output has changed (may optionally revert with a constant)
		rand() and srand() now defined in terms of MT functions
		error_log=syslog now gets errors logged at appropriate syslog levels
		$this
	omit
		dynamic calls to internal functions that rely on scope have been disallowed (too confusing in terms of what the scope is)
		numerical strings now support scientific notation
		destructors on incomplete objects not called
		call_user_func() always warns when the function expects references, but now also always succeeds
		$str[] = 'x' doesn't silently convert to array, but throws an error instead
		invalid octal numbers

deprecations
	mcrypt
	/e modifier for mb_ereg_replace()

performance?
